Step by Step:
Install Full MinGW
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download
-> install MInGW Get installer

in popup window mark all packages in Basic Setup -> installation apply

Go to start menu and select MinGW->Mysis Console or C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\mysis.bat (run as administrator)

change to portaudio directory (cd) (just directory without space, best you put files to c:portaudio this works)
type in ./configure

if there is an error:  no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH 
rename C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab.sample to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab

type in:
make (this takes some time with cryptic symbols)
make install

now you have two files in c:portaudio/lib/.libs
libportaudio-2.dll and libportaudio.dll.a

the dll library file needs to be included into pro file of qt
LIBS += libportaudio-2.dll
and put to C:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\5.4\mingw491_32\bin
