http://portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/compile_windows_mingw.html

Step by Step:
Install Full MinGW
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/latest/download
-> install MInGW Get installer

in popup window mark all packages in Basic Setup -> installation apply

Go to start menu and select MinGW->Mysis Console or C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\mysis.bat (run as administrator)

Take Portaudio directory from Wiesnrun and put it to c:portaudio 
change to portaudio directory (cd) c:/portaudio
type in ./configure

if there is an hint:  no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH 
rename C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab.sample to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab

type in (if error no makefile look at hint before):
make (this takes some time with cryptic symbols)
make install

now you have two files in c:portaudio/lib/.libs
libportaudio-2.dll and libportaudio.dll.a

the dll library file needs to be included into pro file of qt
LIBS += libportaudio-2.dll

and put DLL to (depends on your compiler setting ->
 if you want to know exactly where to put look in qt creator
 "kompilierung" tab there is a string which one of the following three paths):

C:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\5.4\mingw491_32\lib

or (on my other pc)
C:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\Tools\mingw491_32\bin

or (on my antoher other pc):
C:\Qt\Qt5.4.1\5.4\mingw491_32\bin

Run should work no without DLL error
